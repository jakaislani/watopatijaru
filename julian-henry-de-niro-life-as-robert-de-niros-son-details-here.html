His father has been in a number of blockbuster Hollywood films and has received numerous important awards, including two Academy Awards. Robert got to prominence after appearing in Taxi Driver (1976), a film starring Jodie Foster.</strong></p><p>While Robert is one of the most well-known figures in the world, many of you may be unaware of Julian, who has kept his life completely hidden from the public view.</p><p>So, here we will try to find out every intriguing thing about Julian, such as his parents’ relationship, mother, and many more.</p><h2><span id=Robert_De_Niro8217s_son_is_Julian_Henry_De_Niro_What_is_his_mother8217s_name>Robert De Niro’s son is Julian Henry De Niro: What is his mother’s name?</span></h2><p>He and his twin brother Aaron Kendrick De Niro were born in 1995. Toukie Smith, Robert’s long-term partner, and their mother, conceived them via surrogacy.</p><p>Julian’s ethnicity is mixed because his father is of Irish, Italian, Dutch, English, French, and German ancestry. His mother is also Afro-American. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Robert discussed his blended family. He stated,</p><p>“My children are all half-black, and I don’t have, not even me.”</p><h2><span id=Julian8217s_grandfather_was_homosexual>Julian’s grandfather was homosexual.</span></h2><p>He is Robert De Niro Sr.’s and Virginia Admiral’s grandson.

Diahnne Abbott, his stepmother, is her biological mother. Robert, his father, later adopted her. Raphael De Niro, the couple’s son, was born in 1976.</p><p>From his father’s second marriage to actress Grace Hightower, he has two younger half-siblings. In March 1998, the couple had their son, Elliot De Niro. In December 2011, their daughter Helen Grace De Niro was born via surrogacy. Robert was 68 years old when his fifth kid was born.</p><h2><span id=Robert_De_Niro8217s_Father_Tows_Failed_Marriages>Robert De Niro’s Father Tows Failed Marriages</span></h2><p>In 1976, he married Diahnne Abbott for the first time. Nonetheless, their marriage ended in divorce in 1988, after almost 12 years of marriage. In 1997, he married actress Grace Hightower. In 1987, the couple met while Grace was working as a hostess at the restaurant Mr. Chow.</p><p>After they married in 1997, their relationship quickly fell apart, and they divorced in 1999. However, the couple’s divorce was never formalized, and they later reaffirmed their vows in 2004.</p><p>Despite their reunion, they split up again in November 2018. Their highly publicized divorce procedure is still ongoing.</p><p>In October 2003, Robert was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

He rarely makes public appearances. In June 2013, he attended alongside his father, Robert, at the President’s house in Jerusalem, Israel.</p><p>When the journalist asked Robert if his children feel pushed to follow in his footsteps in January 2020. He advised them to pursue their passions rather than just performing. Robert stated,</p><p>“For my kids, I tell them, ‘If you want to be an actor or do this or that, that’s fine as long as you’re happy.”</p><p>He went on,</p><p>“Just don’t undersell yourself.” That’s all I’d recommend – push yourself a little harder and aim for what you truly believe you want to do. Don’t be scared.”</p><h2><span id=Julian_Henry_De_Niro8217s_net_worth>Julian Henry De Niro’s net worth</span></h2><p>His net worth is still being calculated.
