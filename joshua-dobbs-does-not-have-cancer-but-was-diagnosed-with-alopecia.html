When he was five years old, he began playing football.</p><p>He persisted with his game and committed to Arizona State University, where he played collegiate football from 2013 to 2016.</p><p>When Dobbs started losing his hair at the age of ten, many of his followers thought that he had cancer.</p><p>When Dobbs started his undergraduate career, he received an alopecia diagnosis, which he later discovered.</p><p>Hair loss due to the disorder known as alopecia areata may only affect your scalp or the full body, and it may be either temporary or permanent.</p><p>Alopecia areata can be brought on by heredity, hormonal changes, illnesses, or just age.</p><p>For Dobbs, it resulted in the hair on his face and other regions of his body in addition to the hair on his head.</p><p>The player has always been up-forward about his situation and has made use of his platform to inform others about it, which is customary.</p><p>Equally inspiring is Dobbs’ advice for young individuals who might be affected by the ailment.</p><p>He has always treated his health issue as a very little inconvenience and accepted it as a part of who he is. He acknowledged that initially it was difficult to deal with, but that it has now become a moving force in his life.</p><p>Keep in mind that you may achieve all of your goals without having hair, as Dobbs once remarked. You shouldn’t let alopecia get in your way. You live in a culture that emphasizes beauty and is dominated by social media. But at the end of the day, you can be successful and happy whether you have long hair or none at all if you feel comfortable in your skin.</p><p>Dobbs’ parents, Stephanie and Robert, welcomed him into the world on January 26, 1995.</p><p>Well-known Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo Bank is his father. His mother, Stephanie, retired from United Parcel Service and is currently employed with Corporate Human Resources as a regional manager.</p><p>When he first developed an interest in football at the age of five, his parents immediately showed their support for him in his profession. They encouraged and pushed him to pursue his passion in his chosen career path.</p><p>His current net worth is $5 million, which is a considerable sum, according to the sources.</p><p>In 2021, Joshua Dobbs agreed to a 1-year deal with the Tennessee Titans worth $1,035,000, which includes a $1,035,000 intermediate yearly salary.</p><p>He once more agreed to a 1-year contract with the Cleveland Browns on April 9, 2022. His work as a quarterback for a professional football team is his main source of income.</p><p>He might also have unreported additional sources of income from his business and investments.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Was Dale Wolfley, Ron Wolfley Brother | Wikipedia And Age</a></h3>Dale Wolfley was an analyst for Radio & TV Football Color and a former offensive lineman for West Virginia University.
