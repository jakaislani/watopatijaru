Are they still a couple? When Jenny discovered Sumit’s great secret—that he was married to another woman in an arranged marriage put up by his parents, but he genuinely wanted to be with Jenny—they brought tremendous drama to season 1 of The Other Way and delivered one of the most unexpected shocks in series history.</p><p>After a long separation, the worldwide flames came back for season 2 determined to overcome any and all barriers that stood in the way of their love and their happiness together. Unfortunately, by Season 3, their relationship had stopped due to Sumit’s reluctance to propose to Jenny.</p><p>The pair may have gotten married in a private ceremony, but they still had a long road ahead of them. Now that they’re old enough, they may capture the ups and downs of their whirlwind relationship on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">spinoff</a>, Happily Ever After.</p><h2>“90 Day Fiance: The Alternative” New Couples Join the Cast</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/90-Day-Fiance-Are-Jenny-and-Sumit-Still-Together-1024x538.webp alt='"90 Day Fiance: The Alternative" New Couples Join the Cast' width=1024 height=538 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the end, Sumit acknowledged that “complaints” are his “greatest turnoff,” but only after asking Jenny’s permission to do so. (She had thought that “Jenny forgetting” was his worst pet peeve, but it turns out that his perpetual pessimism is much more irritating.)</p><p>Jenny finally acknowledged why: “Because I moan too often.” “I do. You can count on it being accurate. Then Sumit went on to explain his irritation with whining. Whether it’s a uniquely American phenomenon or not, he answered, “I don’t know,” suggesting that it probably wasn’t.</p><p>To paraphrase: “She has problems with everything.”Jenny, however, did not expect a change in attitude from her. “I simply moan,” she said to Us. I’m unable to stop it.” It’s true; I’m a chronic whiner.</p><p>While playing, the pair also to the conclusion that Sumit is the most romantic of the two. Sumit takes care of everything for me… everything he does, I find romantic,” Jenny went on. For Jenny, Sumit said he likes cooking “from morning tea to late-night snacks.”</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Kylen And Jason: ‘TLC Unexpected’ Stars Are They Still Together?</a></p><h2>Tonight’s episode has Jenny confronting Sumit about his wife.</h2><p dir=ltr lang=en>The moment everyone’s been waiting for… Don’t miss a new <a href=# rel=noopener>#90DayFiance</a>: The Other Way Monday at 9/8c! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/R6Gp1hz2RX</a></p><p>— TLC Network (@TLC) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 29, 2019</a></p><p>In the above preview, Jenny admits to the cameras that she is considering leaving India and returning to the United States as Sumit attempts to make amends with his wife and family. “I can’t remain in India anymore,” she says in an emotional confessional.</p><p>It’s been about a week since we last spoke, and I really need Sumit to fill me in on what’s been going on. Even though Jenny will (fingers crossed) get some answers from Sumit on tonight’s show, the reality star is already making arrangements to move back to the United States and crash on her daughter’s sofa.</p><p>Jenny has nothing to return to if she decides to return home after moving to India to be with Sumit. Jenny has forgiven Sumit despite his many deceptions during their relationship (he catfished her for years before exposing his actual identity) because she loves him.</p><p>When he lied to her again, did she forgive him or leave him and return to the United States?</p><h2>Are Jenny and Sumit still a couple after 90 Days?</h2><p>These two aren’t trying to hide anything, at least not from their Instagram followers. As opposed to other couples on reality TV who would try to keep their relationship status under wraps until the season finale, Jenny and Sumit are always happy to share images of themselves with each other.</p><p>Jenny recently informed a follower that she wants to exhibit Sumit America soon after interacting with some admirers in the comments. However, this doesn’t imply they don’t face any difficulties. After being disowned by his parents, Sumit’s main goal in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Season 7 of Happily Ever After</a>?</p><p>Is to win back their love and acceptance. However, Jenny is ready to pack up and move across the pond. But they’ll run into trouble when Sumit doesn’t immediately willing to abandon everything he knows.</p><h2>Sumit wants to please his parents by starting a family right away.</h2><p>Given Jenny’s advanced age, one of the main reasons Sumit’s family opposes his marriage to her is that she cannot have biological children with him. Additionally, they worry that by the time Jenny dies away and Sumit is left alone, he would be too old to have children.</p><p>However, in the episode from October 23, Sumit admits that he does wish to have children with his aunt, brother, and sister-in-law. Unfortunately, Sumit and Jenny have not yet spoken about this.</p><p>And given that Jenny is a grandmother and has grown children, we find it difficult to think that she will be overjoyed at the prospect of having a new baby.</p><p>Producers are informed by Sumit that he can have children through surrogacy or adoption. But once more, Jenny has moved past that stage of her life, and while Sumit freely confesses he doesn’t really want children, he says he’s prepared to have them for his parents.</p><p>There’s just a lot going on, as there usually is with these two. Even though Jenny and Sumit appear to still be dating, they never have it easy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiZopp6q7HNp7BmmZ6ZerTBzKKrZquknrmtedOonp6smJq%2FcH2XaWtxZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-jenny-and-sumit-still-together.html&text=Are%20Jenny%20and%20Sumit%20Still%20Together%20After%2090%20Days%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-jenny-and-sumit-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-jenny-and-sumit-still-together.html&title=Are%20Jenny%20and%20Sumit%20Still%20Together%20After%2090%20Days%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-jenny-and-sumit-still-together.html&title=Are%20Jenny%20and%20Sumit%20Still%20Together%20After%2090%20Days%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-jenny-and-sumit-still-together.html&title=Are%20Jenny%20and%20Sumit%20Still%20Together%20After%2090%20Days%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-jenny-and-sumit-still-together.html&description=Are%20Jenny%20and%20Sumit%20Still%20Together%20After%2090%20Days%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pumpkin-spiced-corn-muffins.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pumpkin Spiced Corn Muffins">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./canadas-drag-race-cast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Meet Canadas Drag Race cast of queens on Instagram  Priyanka, Juice Boxx, Kyne!
