He and his wife,&nbsp;Lyndsay Walter Bell,&nbsp;reside in Norman, Oklahoma. They’ll be married on February 13, 2021, in Southlake, Texas.</p><p>The couple had planned a quiet wedding with just a few close friends and family in attendance. Then, over a year later, on December 31, 2021, while wishing Lyndsay a happy birthday, Blake shares a picture from his wedding on Instagram. Lyndsay was born on December 31st, 1990.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Bell Biography</h2><p>Blake Bell&nbsp;was born on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>August 7, 1991</a>,&nbsp;in&nbsp;Wichita, Kansas, U.S.&nbsp;Bell attended Bishop Carroll Catholic High School in Wichita, Kansas, where he played quarterback.</p><p>The amazing tight end in football is widely recognized for its great physical values, which allow it to compete in tough tournaments.</p><p>He is 32 years old. Miller also has a height advantage, standing at&nbsp;6 feet 6 inches, which is higher than the average height for American males. He weighs&nbsp;114&nbsp;kg.</p><p>According to reports,&nbsp;Mark Bell and Sherry Bell&nbsp;are Blake Bell’s parents.</p><p>Blake was no stranger to the game of football. His dad, Mark Bell, and his uncle, Mike, both played in the NFL. It was his uncle, however, who would unknowingly leave a lasting impression on the future tight end.</p><p>Mike played for the Kansas City Chiefs for 12 years, and his access allowed Blake to see his home team from a perspective that a lot of people didn’t get to see.</p><p>“We would go down on the sidelines every game,” said Mark.</p><p>After being named Gatorade Player of the Year for Bishop Carroll Catholic High School, Blake would play for the Oklahoma Sooners.</p><p>“Going into his senior year, he started at tight end, which is unbelievable. You go into a top ten program and start at tight end.”</p><p>Blake Bell&nbsp;does indeed have a&nbsp;brother. Brock Bell is the name of his elder&nbsp;brother. Brock is Blake’s senior by two years.</p><p>They Have a Daughter TogetherThe couple welcomed their first child together,&nbsp;a daughter Brinleigh, in September 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/22211734/Blake-Bell-children2-1024x890.jpg><p>When Lyndsay celebrated her first Mother’s Day, Blake shared an adorable photo of her cradling their daughter on Instagram.</p><p>Bell’s net worth is expected to reach between&nbsp;$3 and 5 million dollars.&nbsp;He earned most of his money from NFL contracts, which paid generously. For the time being, no details about his endorsement deals are known.</p><p>The Kansas City Chiefs will pay Blake Bell $1.272 million for the 2022-23 season, per a one-year deal signed on March 24, 2022. His rookie deal with the 49ers, signed on May 11, 2015, was $2.785 million over four years.</p><p>The San Francisco 49ers chose him in the fourth round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He attended Oklahoma University and was nicknamed “Belldozer” because of his huge stature and sprinting style.</p><p>As a senior in 2009, he passed for 2,752 yards and 32 touchdowns. Rivals.com listed him as the sixth-best pro-style quarterback prospect.</p><p>The Detroit Tigers chose him in the 43rd round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft, but he did not sign with them.</p><p>On March 18, 2021, Bell signed with the Chiefs. He was added to the Reserve/COVID-19 list on December 21, 2021. He was activated from the Reserve/COVID-19 list on December 24, 2021. Bell re-signed with the Chiefs on March 24, 2022, for one year.</p><p>Bell was put on injured reserve on September 5, 2022. He became active on December 23. Bell scored his first regular-season receiving touchdown for the Chiefs in Week 17 against the Denver Broncos in 2022. Bell won his second Super Bowl with the Chiefs, who beat the Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl LVII. Bell’s third Super Bowl victory came in 2023 when the Chiefs beat the 49ers 25-22 in Super Bowl LVIII.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Ghgossip.com</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpujmqOVYq%2BmuMtmrqKelWLEqbuMm5ylpF2irrO%2ByJ6bZqSpo7G0rdho</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fblake-bell-wife-who-bell-married-lyndsay.html&text=Blake%20Bell%20Wife%3a%20Who%20is%20Blake%20Bell%20married%20to%3f%20Meet%20Lyndsay&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fblake-bell-wife-who-bell-married-lyndsay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fblake-bell-wife-who-bell-married-lyndsay.html&title=Blake%20Bell%20Wife%3a%20Who%20is%20Blake%20Bell%20married%20to%3f%20Meet%20Lyndsay" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fblake-bell-wife-who-bell-married-lyndsay.html&title=Blake%20Bell%20Wife%3a%20Who%20is%20Blake%20Bell%20married%20to%3f%20Meet%20Lyndsay" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fblake-bell-wife-who-bell-married-lyndsay.html&title=Blake%20Bell%20Wife%3a%20Who%20is%20Blake%20Bell%20married%20to%3f%20Meet%20Lyndsay" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fblake-bell-wife-who-bell-married-lyndsay.html&description=Blake%20Bell%20Wife%3a%20Who%20is%20Blake%20Bell%20married%20to%3f%20Meet%20Lyndsay" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brent-bolthouse-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brent Bolthouse Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-shrink-free-spackling-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is shrink free spackling?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
