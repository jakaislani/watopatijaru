Work Hard, Show Love, and Live. I let stories run. Let the miserable complaint. I've never had to put anyone else down to build up my own self-esteem. Anyone that looks to reproduce the past is not living in the present. Water your own grass, eat healthily and drink filtered water. Live. Laugh. Love...#Golden50"</strong></span></p><p><span>The Shade room's official Instagram had confirmed about their engagement that happened as a surprise event on Ty's 50th birthday party and wrote, <strong>"Congrats are in order to #MimiFaust and #TyYoung!!! After rekindling their relationship the couple announced that they are engaged again!!"</strong></span></p><p><span>Mimi hasn't announced the engagement news on her Instagram but she definitely posted a snap of them from the same night and wished her fiancee, Ty a happy birthday writing,<strong> "It's the US!! #BirthdayBehaviour #Golden50."&nbsp;</strong></span></p><h2><strong><span>Mimi Faust Dating Life With Boyfriend Ty Young</span></strong></h2><p><span>Mimi Faust and Ty Young have been dating since 2016. They got engaged in 2020 and Young had posted about it on her Instagram account writing, <strong>"Timing is everything. I've been trying to surprise her since August 2019. From ring complications with the first designer and more; we're finally HERE!!"</strong></span></p><p><span>Mimi had talked about how she wasn't interested to bring her relationship to the show and said, <strong>"Every time someone gets on television with their relationship, it gets messed up. We're trying to manage what we have. If she does a cameo, it'll be Facetime or a phone call. But if we do it, I need to be sure it's going to be a safe scene."</strong></span></p><p><span>However, they called it quits in less than a year of their engagement, and Mimi had talked on Get Into It With Tami Roman's show about her split with Ty Young and said, <strong>"I think the turning point for me was engagement...that's not what I wanted. I had expressed this to Ty, but Ty is a born athlete, she's a natural-born winner, she's just used to getting what she wants. And so that is what she wanted and she pressed about forward with what she wanted, regardless of anybody else saying how they felt about it." She continued, "Me saying that opened up a whole humongous can of worms not only for our relationship but for myself. I had to go to therapy...[In order for it to work], maturation had to have occured and I don't know how long it would have taken for that to happen. There was a lot of things that level for me to consider a lifetime with someone."</strong></span></p><p><span>Gossip of the City had shared images of Ty with another woman named Erica after their engagement was called off. Mimi responded to her former fiancee's new relationship writing, <strong>"I wish them well...I hope they make each other happy. @Tyyoung11 deserves it.[smiley face emoji]"</strong></span></p><p><span>However, they rekindled their relationship and are now engaged for the second time.</span></p><p><span>Mimi Faust was in a toxic relationship with her ex-boyfriend, Stevie J. They even had a daughter together but their relationship came to an end when she found out about his affair with Joseline Hernandez who was his music artist. Mimi then dated Nikko London and made a controversial video together which she admits to regretting now. But she met Ty Young and started her love with her since then.</span></p><h2><span>Net Worth Of Mimi Faust</span></h2><p><span>Mimi Faust has an estimated net worth of $20 million according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a> and her salary is around $20 thousand per episode.

It was titled, Scandal of Atlanta released by infamous pornography company Vivid Entertainment in 2014. She had made it with her then-boyfriend, Nikko London, and shared that she lost the luggage where the tape was kept, so it was staged. However, she had earned more than $30,000 from the tape.
