Her promising career was seemingly derailed at age 13 when a shark bit off her left arm, but she resumed surfing shortly afterward and won a national title in 2005. A successful author and public speaker, Hamilton has shared her experiences in documentary films and appeared on several popular reality TV programs.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years and Surfing</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bethany Meilani Hamilton was born on February 8, 1990, in Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii, to parents Tom and Cheri. Raised in a surfing family, along with older brothers Noah and Tim, Hamilton learned to handle the waves at an early age. She began competitive surfing at age 8, and by age 9 she had earned her first sponsorship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A member of the Hanalei Surf Co. team, the home-schooled Hamilton proved capable of beating more experienced surfers in competition. In May 2003, she won both her age group and the open division of Hawaii's Local Motion/Ezekiel Surf Into Summer event. Shortly afterward, she finished second in the open women's division of the National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA) National Championships at San Clemente, California.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Shark Attack</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On the morning of October 31, 2003, Hamilton went out to surf at Tunnels Beach in Ha'ena with her best friend, Alana Blanchard, and Blanchard's father and brother. While lying on her board, Hamilton suddenly felt intense pressure on her left arm and was pulled back and forth for a few seconds before the flurry passed. Initially feeling no pain, she noticed the water around her had turned red, and her shocked friends realized that her left arm had been severed nearly to the shoulder.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I was holding onto my board, with my thumb, because I probably didn't want to get pulled under. It was like pulling me back and forth, not like pulling me underwater. Just like, you know how you eat a piece of steak? It was kind of like that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanchard's father fashioned a quick tourniquet from his surfboard leash and led everyone to shore. Hamilton was rushed to Wilcox Memorial Hospital, bumping her father from the operating room where he was about to have knee surgery. Although she lost approximately 60 percent of her blood following the attack and underwent several surgeries, she was stabilized and released after a few days.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As the story drew national attention, it was determined that Hamilton had been attacked by a 14-foot tiger shark. Seemingly level-headed about the incident and the radical change to her body, she vowed to return to surfing as soon as possible.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamilton resumed surfing just one month after the attack, her determination helping to keep the story alive in the news cycle. Her 2004 autobiography, Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board, became a best seller, and she was honored for her courage by MTV, ESPN and the United States Sports Academy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamilton went on to publish many more books, including Devotions for the Soul Surfer (2006) and Body and Soul: A Girls Guide to a Fit, Fun and Fabulous Life (2014).</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Return to Competition</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamilton also demonstrated that the loss of an arm was no obstacle to fulfilling her surfing goals. She won the Explorer Women's division at the 2005 NSSA National Championships and began competing on the pro circuit in 2007, winning the T & C Surf Women's Pipeline event that year.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Heart of a Soul Surfer' Doc and Reality TV</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That year also brought the release of Heart of a Soul Surfer, a documentary that chronicled Hamilton's return to the water after the life-altering attack. The documentary helped inspire the creation of Soul Surfer, a 2011 movie about the event starring AnnaSophia Robb as Hamilton.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2014, Hamilton competed on season 25 of The Amazing Race, delivering a strong showing before finishing in third place. She has also appeared on such shows as Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and The Biggest Loser.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Additionally, Hamilton managed to retain her competitive edge in the water despite her busy schedule, snagging first place at the Surf n Sea Pipeline Women’s Pro event in March 2014.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Unstoppable'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamilton has sought to encourage a healthy lifestyle and share stories of her personal faith through speaking engagements, the nonprofit Friends of Bethany and a large social-media following. Her inspiring life became the subject of another documentary, Unstoppable, which debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamilton subsequently launched her Unstoppable Year online course to help people overcome obstacles and achieve fulfillment.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Hamilton began dating youth pastor Adam Dirks in 2012, the two were married in August 2013.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early 2015, Hamilton announced she was pregnant and would soon be scaling back her busy schedule. She and her husband welcomed a son, Tobias, on June 1. Their second son, Wesley, was born in March 2018. The couple's third son, Micah, was born in February 2021.</p><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Bethany Hamilton</li><li>Birth Year: 1990</li><li>Birth date: February 8, 1990</li><li>Birth State: Hawaii</li><li>Birth City: Lihue, Kauai</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Bethany Hamilton overcame the loss of her left arm in a shark attack to become a champion surfer and inspirational public figure.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Sports</li><li>Writing and Publishing</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Aquarius</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=32><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Bethany Hamilton Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/athletes/bethany-hamilton</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: September 29, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: June 5, 2015</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYraCcmsGmv46bnK2gkaPGbrTApqClrJ%2Bj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbethany-hamilton.html&text=Bethany%20Hamilton%20-%20Life%2c%20Age%20%26amp%3b%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbethany-hamilton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbethany-hamilton.html&title=Bethany%20Hamilton%20-%20Life%2c%20Age%20%26amp%3b%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbethany-hamilton.html&title=Bethany%20Hamilton%20-%20Life%2c%20Age%20%26amp%3b%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbethany-hamilton.html&title=Bethany%20Hamilton%20-%20Life%2c%20Age%20%26amp%3b%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbethany-hamilton.html&description=Bethany%20Hamilton%20-%20Life%2c%20Age%20%26amp%3b%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christine-2016.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christine movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-on-july-26th.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="July 26th: All Facts &amp;amp; Events That Happened Today In History">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
