Becoming acting mayor of San Francisco when the sitting mayor was shot and killed in 1978, she ran for the job the following year and won, holding the post until 1988. Two years later, she ran for governor of California but lost. In 1992, however, she became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from California, a seat she held until her death.

Born into a Jewish family, she attended a Roman Catholic school and a Jewish temple as a child and began showing an interest in politics around age 16. After graduating from San Francisco’s Convent of the Sacred Heart High School, Dianne attended Stanford University, where she was active in student government. She graduated with her bachelor’s degree in 1955.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following year, Dianne married Jack Berman, whom she met in the San Francisco district attorney’s office, and later had a daughter named Katherine.

She held the spot until 1966, and two years later, she became a member of the San Francisco Committee on Crime, an appointment that colored the rest of her career. In 1969, Feinstein entered her first political race and was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, eventually becoming the first woman ever to serve as the board’s president, a position she held for two and a half terms.

There is no specific list you can look at and make a judgment: ‘Well everything is going to be just fine.’ You can’t make that judgment. So, I think it’s a last resort. And I’m really hopeful we don’t get to it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following month, Feinstein faced an internal party battle when California Democrats declined to endorse her Senate reelection campaign at their annual convention. Kevin de León, the liberal leader of the California Senate, earned the majority of votes, though he still fell short of the 60 percent needed to claim the party’s endorsement. Feinstein didn’t seem too concerned about the snub, as she held a massive edge in fundraising and a comfortable lead in polls at the time. She went on to defeat de León in the general election by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/california/senate/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="more than eight percentage points" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">more than eight percentage points</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2015, Feinstein worked with North Carolina Senator Richard Burr to secure passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, the nation’s first major cybersecurity bill. It called for information sharing between private companies and the government and included privacy safeguards and liability protections for citizens. President Obama signed the bill into law.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Together with Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, Feinstein introduced bipartisan legislation in 2022 to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=6EE4F785-D8AF-4B57-9A77-5668A2FEB070" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reauthorize and update the Trafficking Victims Protection Act" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">reauthorize and update the Trafficking Victims Protection Act</a>, which seeks to prevent human and sex trafficking, provide services to victims, and increase federal coordination for the government’s response to the issue.
