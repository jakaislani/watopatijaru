Spencer Dutton, John Dutton's younger brother, is now a teenager. Some fans, however, believe Spencer is really Elsa Dutton's son.</span></span><h2>What happens to Elsa Dutton?</h2>At the end of 1883 season 1, Elsa finally succumbs to the infection and dies. Elsa's last wish was for her to pick where she'll be buried, and James and Margaret decide to settle whichever land Elsa chooses – the birth of the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch.<h2>Does James and Margaret Dutton have another baby?</h2>But do the couple have another son? According to The Cinemaholic, Spencer Dutton is James and Margaret's next son. He hasn't been born yet in 1883, and it's unclear if viewers will see how he comes about. But fans see him in the Yellowstone Season 4 premiere in an 1893 flashback.<h2>Who married Elsa Dutton in 1883?</h2>Through 1883 Episode 10, “This Is Not Your Heaven,” audiences finally understand how the Duttons get up in Montana and we discover what happens to Elsa Dutton, as well as what happens to the remaining immigrants, Shea, and Thomas. However, the finale leaves viewers wondering what happens to Elsa and her husband, Sam.<h2>Does Elsa get pregnant in 1883?</h2>1883 not only suggests that Elsa (Isabel May) is pregnant with Ennis' (Eric Nelsen) baby, but that the Duttons could soon face a huge tragedy.<h2>1883 Episode 10 Trailer - Elsa Loses her Baby!</h2><p></p><h2>Is Elsa pregnant with Ennis baby?</h2>Unfortunately, the cowboy died during a conflict with bandits. This series of events has led many fans to believe that Elsa is pregnant with Ennis' child. However, a subtle comment from Elsa in episode 6 of the Yellowstone prequel debunks this theory.<h2>Does Elsa get pregnant?</h2>The night before this happened though, Elsa lost her virginity to Ennis which was followed by conversations of pregnancy and raising a baby. Since Ennis will no longer feature, fans want to know if his legacy will live on in the form of a child.<h2>Who does Elsa Dutton end up with?</h2>Love life. Elsa took a liking to Ennis, one of the cowhands that went along with the wagon train she travels with. Soon they both stated their love for each other and eventually their relationship even got the blessing of the skeptical James Dutton.<h2>Is Elsa Dutton John's grandmother?</h2>Elsa Dutton - John's great aunt<p>As John Dutton Junior came into the mix, Elsa is Costner's character's great aunt. Elsa's personality traits are evident in some of the Yellowstone characters, including Beth (Kelly Reilly) and Tate (Brecken Merrill).</p><h2>What is Elsa Dutton to John Dutton?</h2>Elsa is John Dutton Sr.'s (played by Audie Rick) sister. As for John Dutton (played by Kevin Costner in Yellowstone), on the other hand, she is his great aunt.<h2>What were Elsa's last words?</h2>Elsa Dutton and James Dutton seemingly sat for hours beneath the tree in 1883 episode 10. It's clear to both of them that Elsa will die under that tree. When she finally starts to go, she has a few final words for her father after seeing a bird. “You birds sure are smart,” Elsa says to the bird.<h2>Does Elsa marry Sam?</h2>Taylor Sheridan's Yellowstone prequel, 1883, shows life on the Great Plains — and it hasn't been easy for the Dutton family or the immigrant travelers.<h2>Is Spencer Elsa's son?</h2>Spencer has an older sister named Elsa and a brother named John. His aunt, Claire, his father's sister, her husband Henry and their daughter Mary Abel all died before he was born.<h2>Do Sam and Elsa end up together?</h2>In a stunning twist, Elsa decides that she will not make the rest of the journey to Oregon, opting to stay with Sam, marry him and make a life together. It's a decision that garners a great deal of pushback from James and especially Margaret (Faith Hill), who is not ready to relinquish control over her daughter yet.<h2>Did Elsa Dutton get married?</h2>Congratulations are in order: 1883's Miss Elsa Dutton has gotten herself hitched. And because this is one of the few shows in which that phrase might be taken literally, allow me to clarify: Elsa gets married in Sunday's episode.<h2>Did Elsa meet Sam heaven?</h2>With one final piece of narration, Elsa explains that she is now in Heaven and we see her reunite with her Comanche husband, Sam, after the pair got married in episode 8. The pair are overjoyed to see one another and they gallop off into the sunset across the picturesque Great Plains.<h2>Where is Elsa buried in Yellowstone?</h2>Elsa Dutton dies in her father's arms<p>During Elsa's final moments, James takes his daughter to an open area and they rest by a very specific tree — a tree that "Yellowstone" fans quickly recognized (via Twitter). "This is the spot," she tells her father.</p><h2>Is Yellowstone Ranch named after Elsa?</h2>As some 1883 viewers probably guessed, especially after Episode 109 made it clear that Elsa was a goner, the eventual site for the Yellowstone Ranch within Montana's Paradise Valley was directly tied to Elsa's death, and it also all tethers to another important event connecting the Duttons to surrounding native ...<h2>Who is the oldest Dutton child on Yellowstone?</h2>So much has happened in Yellowstone's first few seasons that it's easy to forget John Dutton had four children in the series pilot. His oldest son Lee was his favorite, and he was the heir to the family business.<h2>Who is John Dutton's grandmother?</h2>Isabel May of Young Sheldon fame and LaMonica Garrett of The CW's superhero series are on board 1883 coming to Paramount+, and here's what we know so far. Isabel May has been cast to play the oldest daughter of John and Margaret Dutton, and therefore the grandmother of Kevin Costner's John Dutton on Yellowstone.<h2>Who was John Dutton's father?</h2>John Dutton Sr., originally known as John Dutton, is a main character in 1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story. He is the eldest son of James Dutton and Margaret Dutton of the Dutton Family. He is one of at least three John's in the family, the others being his son, John Dutton Jr., and his grandson, John Dutton III.<h2>Will Isabel May be in season 2 of 1883?</h2>At the end of 1883 season 1, it became pretty clear that Sam Elliott and Isabel May would not be returning for season 2, as their characters Shea Brennan and Elsa Dutton were killed off. Future episodes of 1883 will likely pick up where season 1 left off and address these shocking deaths.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8Oim2adnKiubrDUrauopl2drrexjJpkm5mSrg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-elsa-dutton-have-a-baby.html&text=Did%20Elsa%20Dutton%20have%20a%20baby%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-elsa-dutton-have-a-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-elsa-dutton-have-a-baby.html&title=Did%20Elsa%20Dutton%20have%20a%20baby%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-elsa-dutton-have-a-baby.html&title=Did%20Elsa%20Dutton%20have%20a%20baby%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-elsa-dutton-have-a-baby.html&title=Did%20Elsa%20Dutton%20have%20a%20baby%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-elsa-dutton-have-a-baby.html&description=Did%20Elsa%20Dutton%20have%20a%20baby%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eva-longoria-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eva Longoria Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Income">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./boruto-just-got-the-biggest-glow-up-in-naruto-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boruto just got the biggest glow-up in Naruto history">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
