She is a songwriter, musician, record producer, and actress, as well as an R&B and soul vocalist.</strong></p><p>Hinds and Gray’s marriage lasted only a few years. Despite their brief marriage, the former husband and wife had three children. While they were unable to salvage their marriage, the tragedy gave birth to a star, Macy Gray, who inspired her first album and won the Grammy Award.</p><p>Many people have heard of the artist, but nothing is known about her ex-husband. So, where has he gone? What happened to their marriage? Tracey Hinds, Macy Gray’s spouse, will be the center of this story.</p><h2><span id=Tracey_Hinds_Macy_Gray8217s_Ex-Husband_Who_Is_He>Tracey Hinds, Macy Gray’s Ex-Husband, Who Is He?</span></h2><p>Tracey Hinds, the singer’s husband, is an African-American who was born in the United States of America and holds American citizenship. When they were together, he worked as an American mortgage broker. However, it is unknown whether he is still in that career or has switched to another.</p><p>Apart from his birth nation, no additional information regarding his history or early life is known. His birthday, parents, education, and everything else are unknown. Because his wife’s name was likewise not a popular name when they married, no one was interested in learning about them, resulting in a paucity of information on him in the media.</p><h2><span id=Tracey_Hinds_and_Macy_Gray8217s_Marriage>Tracey Hinds and Macy Gray’s Marriage</span></h2><p>Hinds and his ex-wife Gray were married for barely a few years. The ex-friends reconnected in Los Angeles, where Macy had recently relocated from her hometown. When the singer was looking for work in her new city, she found the love of her life.</p><p>The ex-couple was madly in love with each other and chose to marry in 1996 after dating for roughly two years. When they were just girlfriend and boyfriend, everything was going swimmingly between them. However, after marriage, not everything remained the same.</p><p>Tracey and Macy began to have issues with each other, which led to everyday disagreements and unhappiness in their relationship. As a result, the husband and wife divorced in 1998, just a year before Macy had her first successful album. So, what caused the couple’s marriage partnership to end? Find out by reading the subtitle below!</p><h2><span id=Why_did_Tracey_Hinds_divorce_his_wife_Macy_Gray>Why did Tracey Hinds divorce his wife, Macy Gray?</span></h2><p>As previously said, when the pair was solely in a love relationship, everything was fine. But after they married and had children, everything turned upside down. Parenting wasn’t as easy as they expected, and having two children to look after was difficult.</p><p>Raising children while suffering in their work was difficult for them. Despite the difficulties, the couple persevered in the belief that things would improve in the future. Unfortunately, relations between the two never improved.</p><p>Tracey and his ex-wife later divorced after a year of marriage, while she was pregnant with their third kid. Regardless, their courtship officially terminated in 1998. She then relocated to Ohio to live with her mother because she had nowhere else to go with two tiny children by her side and another inside her.</p><p>According to the singer,</p><p>“When my ex-husband and I divorced, I had nowhere to go.” Nobody wants to move back into their mother’s house. You just feel like a failure. But where else could I go with two kids?”</p><p>Tracey has kept himself very quiet since then, refusing to say whether or not he dated or married anyone after that. Meanwhile, the singer is now single and has not had any significant relationships since her divorce from her ex-husband.</p><h2><span id=Tracey_is_the_mother_of_two_daughters_and_one_son>Tracey is the mother of two daughters and one son.</span></h2><p>Despite the fact that the husband and wife’s marriage did not endure long, they had three children during their marriage. On January 16, 1995, Tracey Hinds and his then-wife welcomed their first child, a daughter Aanisah Hinds. Tahmel Hinds, their second child, was born in December 1995, and Happy Hinds, their youngest daughter, was born on October 6, 1997.</p><p>All three children are now adults, having graduated and settled into their careers. His daughter Aanisah studied Visual and Performing Arts before graduating with a degree in painting. Similarly, Tahmel is said to be a musician who follows in his mother’s footsteps, while Happy is the editor-in-chief of Happy Hinds Magazine.</p><p>Nonetheless, the father is not on good terms with his children, despite the fact that he used to see them on occasion. His ex-wife raised them all while pursuing her own profession. The couple’s divorce also resulted in the absence of the father’s love in the lives of the children.</p><h2><span id=Macy8217s_first_album_was_inspired_by_his_divorce>Macy’s first album was inspired by his divorce.</span></h2><p>The mortgage broker and his ex-girlfriend supposedly had a terrible dispute at the time of their detachment and have yet to reconcile. However, their conclusion became Macy Gray’s new beginning. In 1999, a year after her divorce, Macy published her debut album On How Life Is, which was a big hit and catapulted her to prominence.</p><p>She has already released 10 albums and 25 singles as a main artist as a result of her popularity. She has also performed as a featured artist on various songs, promotional singles, music videos, and made guest appearances. Macy Gray is now well-known as an R&B and soul singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actress.</p><p>Her career has taken off since the release of her first record, and she has never looked back. Furthermore, Macy Gray has received numerous honors and has been nominated for five Grammy Awards, winning one. She received her first Grammy Award for best female pop vocal performance for “I Try” in 2001.</p><h2><span id=Tracey_Hinds8217_Net_Worth_Is_His_Ex-Wife_Macy_Gray_Wealthy>Tracey Hinds’ Net Worth; Is His Ex-Wife Macy Gray Wealthy?</span></h2><p>Tracey’s net worth is unknown as of 2022 because little is known about his profession. However, as a mortgage broker, he may have earned enough money for himself and his family, assuming he has any.</p><p>His ex-wife, Macy Gray, is a multi-millionaire with a net worth of $12 million. She is wealthy enough to provide a lavish lifestyle for her children and herself as a result of her ability to gain widespread recognition and popularity.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Tracey_Hinds8217_Gender>What Is Tracey Hinds’ Gender?</span></h2><p>People are still confused about Macy’s ex-beau Tracey’s sexuality, possibly due to her name or other factors. This misperception may have evolved as the name “Tracey” is more commonly associated with girls.</p><p>However, given that he was married to a woman and had three children with her, it is clear that he is or was a man at the time of his marriage. We don’t know if he changed his gender after the divorce because he dropped out of the spotlight.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Svetlana Permyakova</a></h3>Svetlana Permyakova estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
