One of the newer characters added to Genshin Impact, Shenhe, also works great with Ayaka.</span></span></span></span><h2>Does Ayaka work well with Ganyu?</h2>Is ayaka good with ganyu for a permafreeze team? (Also a hydro like xingqui/mona) | Fandom. No, she is a very good support for Ayaka considering that her burst gives a 20% cryo damage bonus to those in the field at A4.<h2>Is Diona good with Ayaka?</h2>Diona is a great teammate for Ayaka and is one of the cheapest ones to build, as she really only needs HP and Energy Recharge. She can provide her team with shields and healing while also granting Ayaka a massive amount of Energy, thanks to her Elemental Skill.<h2>Is Rosaria good with Ayaka?</h2>Rosaria is a great alternative battery option and she can help increase Ayaka's crit rate even further with her Shadow Samaritan passive talent – better yet, she will be featuring on Ayaka's rerun banner, so if you don't have her already you will get a chance soon.<h2>Is Ayaka good with kazuha?</h2>They go great on a team together, though =) But yes, both are amazing characters. (Ayaka seems to be solidifying a place as top dps in the game, while Kazuha is one of the best supports, losing out only to Bennett).<h2>TOP 5 Most Popular AYAKA Teams In Genshin Impact 2.6</h2><p></p><h2>Is Ayaka good with Xingqiu?</h2>Ayaka's Normal Attack animations are very quick, and since she can infuse her own Normal Attacks with Cryo, Ayaka pairs greatly with Xingqiu.<h2>Is Kaeya good with Ayaka?</h2>Kaeya is one of the most underrated characters in Genshin Impact. This Cavalry Captain is often overlooked, despite having the potential to be a great damage dealer. Furthermore, Kaeya also makes a great Cryo support. His Elemental Skill generates a decent amount of energy, so he can be a good battery for Ayaka.<h2>Is Thoma good with Ayaka?</h2>Passing Thoma's Blazing Barrier and Scorching Ooyoroi over to Ayaka will also grant her exceptional protection against Pyro foes, as well as enable consistent Melt Reactions when her attacks mix with Thoma's Fiery Collapses.<h2>Is Ayaka good with Ayato?</h2>Now that he's in Genshin Impact, it's incredibly satisfying to see how well Ayato and Ayaka work together. To start, Cryo and Hydro are two elements that work well together. The Elemental Reaction between the two will freeze characters.<h2>Does Ayaka like the traveler?</h2>Ayaka does have some feelings towards the Traveler, and that has been quite evident in the game. However, it is emphasized that during the Prayer Plaques scene, the Traveler is only thinking about reuniting with their sibling which makes Ayaka believe that they are not meant to be together.<h2>Who is better support for Ayaka?</h2>Kokomi is a premium support character that works extremely well with Ayaka. Her hydro application can be considered better than both Xingqiu and Mona when paired with Ayaka.<h2>Does Ayaka work with Zhongli?</h2>You can build Zhongli to be a great sub-DPS and use him primarily for his shield, supporting your DPS characters such as Ayaka.<h2>Is Ayaka stronger than Xiao?</h2>Ayaka, being a Cryo DPS, would benefit from reaction damage as well, it is not that hard to understand the logic here. Xiao is considered a great DPS character by many Genshin Impact players, so for there to be some leakers claiming that Ayaka's DPS will surpass Xiao's is quite impressive.<h2>Is Ayaka stronger than Ganyu?</h2>Interestingly, in terms of damage, Ayaka overshadows Ganyu easily. However, Ganyu is a very versatile character and arguably is the only character to fulfill both roles perfectly. Therefore, she can be an immense help in Spiral Abyss as well as open-world challenges.<h2>Who is better venti or Ayaka?</h2>Hence, after considering all factors, Ayaka is a better character than Venti because of her versatility. She's far more relevant in the meta, whereas Venti can be replaced by the likes of Kazuha and Sucrose. Having said that, Genshin Impact players should always wish for the characters that excite them the most.<h2>Is Kamisato Ayato or Ayaka better?</h2>Turns out being the younger of the two siblings gave Ayaka an advantage. Her in-game talents are more generous and more creative compared to Ayato. Ayaka's main advantage when it comes to talents is that her dodge/evade or sprint is a Cryo version of Mona's, making her one of the best characters for exploration.<h2>Who should I pull Ayaka or Ayato?</h2>If possible, you should try to have both Ayato and Ayaka in the same party as they are an amazing Freeze comp. For those who don't have the money to pull them both, though, everything really depends on whether you need a Cryo Sub-DPS or a Hydro DPS to slot into your team.<h2>Is Ayaka better than Kaeya?</h2>Because Ayaka is statistically more powerful than Kaeya.<h2>Is Fischl good with Ayaka?</h2>Best Team for Ayaka<p>Or you might choose an Electro character to create a Superconduct, which reduces your opponent's Physical Defense while spreading Ayaka's Cryo damage. Fischl is always a great choice for players in need of an Electro, bow, or support character.</p><h2>Does Qiqi work with Ayaka?</h2>Qiqi doesn't provide much utility with Ayaka, as she can't generate any particles for Ayaka's OP (but 80 energy) burst. Diluc also doesn't fit, as Ayaka and him are both main dps characters.<h2>Is Ayaka good with Hu Tao?</h2>Ayaka is also a strong DPS unit on her own, easily capable of shouldering the role alongside Hu Tao. If used back-to-back, Ayaka and Hu Tao's Bursts can do absolutely massive damage together, a popular combo for clearing Spiral Abyss floors.<h2>Is Kokomi good for Ayaka?</h2>Kokomi holds the element Hydro while Ayaka uses the element Cryo. When using their elemental burst, Kokomi can walk on water while Ayaka can freeze the water or better known as "ice-bridge". The both of them can fit well in a freeze comp team by a lot. Ayaka can be a main DPS while Kokomi can be a healer.<h2>Is Ayaka good Genshin Impact?</h2>The best Genshin Impact Ayaka build will freeze your foes. Ice to meet you. Many tough characters have stepped onto the stage since Ayaka first arrived back in Genshin Impact 2.0, but she still manages to be one of the best Cryo characters in the game.<h2>Who is Ayaka crush?</h2>There were lots of implications that Ayaka had a crush on the Traveler due to her Story Quest and her special dish description, which was the reason why Ayather sailed.<h2>Who is Ayaka most shipped with?</h2>Ayamiya is the femslash ship between Kamisato Ayaka and Naganohara Yoimiya from the Genshin Impact fandom.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lk52us63CrZyrq12Wv6Z5xqimnWWnnsGpecCymKSZ</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-characters-are-good-with-ayaka.html&text=What%20characters%20are%20good%20with%20Ayaka%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-characters-are-good-with-ayaka.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-characters-are-good-with-ayaka.html&title=What%20characters%20are%20good%20with%20Ayaka%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-characters-are-good-with-ayaka.html&title=What%20characters%20are%20good%20with%20Ayaka%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-characters-are-good-with-ayaka.html&title=What%20characters%20are%20good%20with%20Ayaka%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-characters-are-good-with-ayaka.html&description=What%20characters%20are%20good%20with%20Ayaka%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./whole-roasted-cauliflower-recipe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whole Roasted Cauliflower Recipe | Mom On Timeout">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./to-your-eternity-season-2-release-date-and-where-you-can-watch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="To Your Eternity season 2 release date and where you can watch">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
